## Introduction

Plastic waste poses a pressing global challenge, with vast amounts accumulating in landfills and ecosystems. The M/CE-R01 Circular Economy Methodology for Encouraging Plastic Recycling aims to address this issue by empowering and formalizing plastic recycling projects, particularly within the informal sector, to align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and foster a transition towards a circular economy (CE). By introducing circular plastic credits (CPCs) as incentives for responsible manufacturers, this framework seeks to incentivize investment in plastic recycling initiatives and drive systemic change in plastic usage and disposal practices.

Implemented effectively, this methodology holds the potential to not only mitigate environmental impacts but also empower communities involved in plastic recycling and provide transparent, verifiable data for informed decision-making. By catalyzing the adoption of sustainable practices and fostering collaboration across sectors, it offers a pathway towards a more sustainable and circular plastic economy.

## Scope

It covers a range of activities, including the establishment of new recycling facilities, capacity enhancements in existing facilities, retrofitting of idle facilities, and improvements in collection or sorting capacities. By providing options for involvement from both formal and informal sectors, the framework seeks to promote transparency, compliance, and accountability in plastic recycling initiatives while contributing to the transition towards a circular economy.


## Applicability

This methodology applies to projects meeting the following criteria:

- Plastic waste sourced from various locations including land, water bodies, dumpsites, and urban areas, among others.
- Recycling of plastic types such as PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE, PP, PS, and others as outlined in the VPCE's Protocol.
- Compliance with local and national regulations, ensuring environmental and social safeguards.
- Accurate estimation of recycled plastic volume, either through direct monitoring or a mass balance approach.
- Maintenance of an identifiable end-use market for recycled plastic, excluding fuel production.
- Proper management of non-recycled plastic waste to prevent environmental contamination.
- Implementation of contractual agreements for monitored use of recycled plastic by end consumers.
- Non-competition or diversion of plastic waste from other recycling facilities.

- Special conditions apply to projects involving chemical recycling, imported plastic waste, collection activities prioritizing local employment and gender equality, informal recycling facilities, and transboundary movements, each with specific compliance requirements outlined within the methodology.
  
## Project Boundary

The project boundary spans from the sites where plastic waste originates to its ultimate utilization as raw material. This includes the initial generation sites, waste collection points, gathering and sorting facilities, as well as plastic waste recycling facilities. Furthermore, it extends to identifiable plants or retailers where the recycled plastic serves as feedstock for industrial processes or the manufacturing of new products.

## Baseline Scenarios

For plastic recycling, the baseline scenarios correspond to the amount of plastic waste that would have been recycled in the project area.

## Policy Workflow

![MCE-R01 Workflow](https://github.com/Mcnoble1/DLT-Earth-Hack-Methodologies/assets/40045755/1ae1c230-8b18-4b8c-a0ee-5cf665259bfd)


## Policy Guide

This policy is published to the Hedera network and can be imported via Github (.policy file) or IPFS timestamp. 
 
## Available Roles

- Project Participant - The project participant is responsible for executing the emission reduction project. The project participant must adhere to the requirements outlined by the CDM and provide evidence of the emission reductions achieved. Upon successful verification, the project participant receives certified emission reduction (CER) tokens as an incentive for their emission reductions.  
- Verification and Validation Body (VVB) - The VVB plays a critical role in independently verifying and validating the project data submitted by the project participant. They thoroughly assess the project's emission reduction potential, methodologies, and adherence to the policy guidelines. Based on their evaluation, the VVB either approves or rejects the project for registration.  
- Registry (UNFCCC) - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as the registry for the CDM. They oversee the multiple workflow steps involved in the project's approval, including the verification and validation process by the VVB. The UNFCCC's approval is necessary for the project's successful registration and issuance of CER tokens. 

## Important Documents and Schemas

Project Description - Project Participant information, standard project information, methodology information like baseline emissions, project emissions, etc. 

Emissions Reduction – Schema included within the project information form; this is filled out by the project participant to calculate annual emission reductions. 

Monitoring Report – The monitoring report is to be filled out based on the monitoring plan mentioned within the methodology.   

## Token (Carbon Emission Reduction)

Circular Plastic Credits (CPC), each equivalent to one tonne of CO2. 
Circular Economy Credits (CEC), each equivalent to one tonne of CO2.

### Step By Step
